            Shirley began dancing when she was nine years old, 
            training in classical Chinese dance at the Academy 
            of Chinese Performing Arts. At age fifteen, Shirley 
            decided to focus more on ballet and began training 
            at the Ramon Moreno School of Ballet. She later danced 
            as a trainee with the American Repertory Ballet performing 
            roles in Raymonda, Giselle, and The Nutcracker.
